Project Description



DR.strangediagnoses you with the worst possible disease for whatever symptoms you may be experiencing. To make the experience even more dramatic, it features a personality test: the worse your personality, the grimmer your diagnosis. Sometimes, you‚Äôre ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù straight to (virtual) heaven or hell!




The Problem (that doesn't exist)


Are people feeling far too comfortable with reasonable health apps and thoughtful diagnoses? The world needs a way to instantly assume the worst about every minor symptom‚Ä¶and judge their personality at the same time.


The Solution (that nobody asked for)



WithDR.Strange, enter your symptoms and complete a personality test, then watch as the app‚Äîpowered by generative AI‚Äîdiagnoses you with the most absurd, cataclysmic illness possible. If your personality test goes badly, things only get more catastrophic, sometimes leading to a fate worse than (virtual) death.
